🍽️ Restaurant Data Analysis (Zomato Dataset)
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing restaurant data to understand customer preferences and ordering behavior. The analysis is performed using Python with an emphasis on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization. The goal is to extract meaningful insights related to ratings, votes, restaurant types, and online ordering trends.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following analyses were performed:
•	Distribution of restaurant ratings
•	Count of restaurants by type
•	Online vs offline ordering comparison
•	Votes analysis across different restaurant categories
•	Relationship between ratings and online ordering
Visualizations used include:
•	Bar charts
•	Count plots
•	Histograms
•	Box plots
•	Heatmaps
